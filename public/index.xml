      <description>IntroductionThe two datasets that were chosen are a 2016 national county voting data dataset, and a 2016 national county health outcomes data dataset. Both are organized by row, with each row being a county. The voting data contains a variety of statistics, like percentage of a count voting base under 29, percentage of a county living rurally, total voting age population of a county, votes recorded for democratic senate races, votes recorded for 3rd party presidential races, etc.</description>

      <description>IntroductionBefore the data can be used, it has to be cleaned and joined together.This results in a 2297 row by 31 column sheet, containing every players season stats for the 2015-16 to the 2018-19 season, as well as whether or not they placed into All NBA. The dataset is trimmed to only contain “starters”, or players with at least 41 games started in the season (half total games). This reduces the set to 547 observations of players who could potentially earn All NBA.</description>

      <description>This is some basic python code showing how the language can be used in data science. Our example will be a reading of Great Expectations by Thomas Paine!Lets start by loading in the book. The textfile “CommonSense.txt” contains all the information. We will also load in some necessary packages.
import reimport collectionsimport operator#array for all wordswordList=[]#read novel into linesnovel = open(&amp;quot;CommonSense.txt&amp;quot;)lines = novel.</description>
